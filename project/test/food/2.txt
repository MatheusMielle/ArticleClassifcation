3/4 c.

1 tsp.

1/4 tsp.

1/2 c.

FOR THE SHELLS:
2 c. 
all-purpose flour, plus more for surface
1/4 c. 
granulated sugar
1 tsp. 
kosher salt
1/2 tsp. 
cinnamon
4 tbsp. 
cold butter, cut into cubes
6 tbsp. 
white wine
1 
large egg
1

Vegetable oil, for frying 


DIRECTIONS
MAKE FILLING:
1.	 Drain ricotta by placing it a fine mesh strainer set over a large bowl. Let drain in refrigerator for at least an hour and up to overnight. 
2.	In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat heavy cream and 1/4 cup powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. 
3.	In another large bowl, combine ricotta, mascarpone, remaining 1/4 cup powdered sugar, vanilla, orange zest, and salt. Fold in whipped cream. Refrigerate until ready to fill cannoli, at least 1 hour.
MAKE SHELLS:
1.	In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, and cinnamon. Cut butter into flour mixture with your hands or pastry cutter until pea-sized. Add wine and egg and mix until a dough forms. Knead a few times in bowl to help dough come together. Pat into a flat circle, then wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour and up to overnight. 
2.	On a lightly floured surface, divide dough in half. Roll one half out to ⅛” thick. Use a 4” circle cookie cutter to cut out dough. Repeat with remaining dough. Re-roll scraps to cut a few extra circles. 
3.	Wrap dough around cannoli molds and brush egg whites where the dough will meet to seal together. 
FOR FRYING:
1.	In a large pot over medium heat, heat about 2" of oil to 360°. Working in batches, add cannoli molds to oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden, about 4 minutes. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool slightly. 
2.	When cool enough to handle or using a kitchen towel to hold, gently twist shells off of molds to remove. 
3.	Place filling in a pastry bag fitted with an open star tip. Pipe filling into shells, then dip ends in mini chocolate chips. 
FOR AIR FRYER:
1.	Working in batches, place molds in basket of air fryer and cook at 350° for 12 minutes, or until golden. 
2.	When cool enough to handle or using a kitchen towel to hold, gently remove twist shells off of molds. 
3.	Place filling in a pastry bag fitted with an open star tip. Pipe filling into shells, then dip ends in mini chocolate chips.

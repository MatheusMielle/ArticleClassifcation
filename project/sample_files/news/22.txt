A Vermont man is being held without bail after allegedly hitting a teen with his truck and dumping him in a nearby ravine Wednesday night, according to a police report. 

Parker Clark, 20, was doing donuts in a Greensboro parking lot when he struck Tyler Friend, 19, with his truck, police said. Clark allegedly loaded Friend into his truck and drove him to a remote Craftsbury farm, according to the police report.

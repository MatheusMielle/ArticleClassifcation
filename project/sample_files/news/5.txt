Then dash camera captured Duran allegedly pointing the firearm at Garcia’s face through the glass. "F***ing stop that s*** m*****f*****, f***ing stop that s***," he shouts, still with the gun drawn. He then is seen shifting the gun to his less dominant hand before punching the glass several times.

Garcia said he was driving when another vehicle began drifting into his lane. He told Fox 10 he sped up and merged into the lane he believed the suspect was leaving. Duran allegedly grew angry thinking Garcia cut him off. Both men pulled over, and Garcia wanted to take down the Duran’s license plate. 

Duran also allegedly assaulted Garcia before Garcia returned to his car.

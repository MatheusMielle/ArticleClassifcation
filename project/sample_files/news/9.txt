A Washington state trooper made a surprising discovery jammed inside the back of a U-Haul truck during a traffic stop earlier this week. 

Okanogan Trooper Cunningham pulled over a driver hauling a car that was partially hanging out the back of the truck on Highway 97 north of Okanogan, Washington State Patrol Trooper John Bryant tweeted Monday.

"I suppose it's moving season," Bryant said.

Since the driver didn’t have a valid license and the rented U-Haul was overdue for return, both vehicles were impounded, according to the station.

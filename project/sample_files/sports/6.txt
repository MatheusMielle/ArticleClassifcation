Video: Russell Westbrook Breaks NBA Record with 10th Straight Triple-Double

Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook posted an NBA-record 10th straight triple-double in Monday's 120-111 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.
Westbrook was sitting one assist shy of a triple-double before setting up Paul George for a three-pointer with 3:51 remaining in the fourth quarter:
As a result, the 2017 MVP moved ahead of Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a row, per ESPN Stats & Info:
Westbrook finished with 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists against Portland.
During his MVP-winning season, the eight-time All-Star was the first NBA player since Oscar Robertson in 1962 to average a triple-double over a full season. Now, Westbrook is on pace to average double figures in points, rebounds and assists for the third year in a row.
After Monday night, he's putting up 21.2 points, 11.1 rebounds and 11.2 assists per game.
Unlike 2017 and 2018, though, Westbrook's heroics may not be entirely in vain. Oklahoma City is coming off back-to-back first-round playoff exits but sits third in the Western Conference at 37-19. According to NBA.com, the Thunder are 13th in offensive rating (110.3) and third in defensive rating (104.9).
Westbrook may not even be the most important player on the team, either. Paul George is third in NBA.com's most recent MVP Ladder and earned a triple-double of his own Monday (47 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists).
Although the Thunder would be clear underdogs against the Golden State Warriors in a seven-game postseason series, they seem poised to make a deep playoff run this summer, something they haven't done since Kevin Durant left for the Bay Area.

Browns land blockbuster deal for Giants WR Odell Beckham Jr.
Weeks of rumors and speculation finally came true. The Cleveland Browns are acquiring wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. from the New York Giants in a blockbuster trade for one of the NFL’s most popular players.
The move will continue the transformation of the Browns from a young rebuilding franchise to an immediate playoff contender. Others have now confirmed Mike Garafolo’s initial report.
The preliminary details of the deal:
•	Browns receive: Beckham
•	Giants receive: 2019 first-round pick (No. 17 overall), Cleveland’s lower third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers
The trade cannot be made final until Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.
Instant Reaction
The Browns acquiring one of the best wide receivers in the NFL, if not the best. OBJ provides an instant impact to the roster and will give the Browns a legitimate outside vertical presence and an alpha wide receiver for Baker Mayfield to lean on. This move also reunites Beckham with his best friend and former college teammate Jarvis Landry.
While this move may shock many, it’s something the Browns may have been planning for a while. Remember, it was only last July when we saw Mayfield putting in work with Landry, Beckham and David Njoku.
Final Thoughts
No matter what the Browns gave up, it is important to remember they have their franchise quarterback on a rookie contract and now is the time to make bold moves. If acquiring Beckham creates buzz around the franchise, makes Mayfield happy, creates an atmosphere veterans will be drawn to and wins games, then this trade has nothing but upside for the Cleveland Browns.

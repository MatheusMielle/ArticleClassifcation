Bears fans are reliving the horror of Cody Parkey's infamous 'double doink' on 3rd anniversary

It’s hard to believe it’s been three years since Cody Parkey’s infamous “double doink” missed field goal forever changed the trajectory of the Bears franchise under head coach Matt Nagy.
The Bears hosted the Eagles in a wild-card playoff game on Jan. 6, 2019, which was decided by a 43-yard field goal attempt by Parkey as time expired. And it’s haunted the Bears ever since.
We all know what happened. Parkey’s kick doinked not once, but twice, off the crossbar and didn’t go in, cutting Chicago’s playoff journey far too short.
Bears fans would like to forget. But they’ve yet to been given the chance as Parkey’s infamous “double doink” will forever be ingrained into the minds of the NFL world. (Much like I’m reminding you now.)
But the drama didn’t stop there. It was Parkey’s appearance on NBC’s “Today Show” the day after his miss that sealed his fate with the Bears. Nagy described Parkey’s actions as “me not we” move, and he was released by the Bears on March 13.
As the NFL world has a laugh at the expense of Bears fans on the third anniversary of the “double doink,” here’s how Bears fans are feeling:

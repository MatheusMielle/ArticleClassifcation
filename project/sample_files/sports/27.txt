What you need to know for Sunday's MLB games
By Todd Zola
Those playing in fantasy leagues in which the lineups lock with the first game of the day need to get an early start on Sundays this season, as there will routinely be a game starting at 11:35 a.m. ET. This week's showcase features the San Diego Padres visiting Kyle Wright (90% rostered in ESPN leagues) and the Atlanta Braves. Wright began the season as one of the game's pleasant surprises, but as he exhibited in his most recent outing against the Boston Red Sox, he's still raw and vulnerable to productive lineups. In head-to-head leagues, needs dictate whether to start the 26-year-old right-hander, but if ratios are close, consider benching Wright against a patient Padres offense with a low strikeout rate.
•	Tyler Wells (8% rostered), on the other hand, is in a favorable spot on the road as the Baltimore Orioles wrap up a set in Comerica Park against the Detroit Tigers. The converted reliever is coming off his first quality start of the season, limiting the Kansas City Royals to one run in six frames. The Tigers are, by far, the lowest-scoring team in May, averaging just over two runs per game this month.
•	After winning his MLB debut, Hunter Greene (26%) has lost his next five starts. The fireballing freshman is in a great position to end the streak when the suddenly hot Cincinnati Reds visit the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Bucs whiff at the fifth-highest clip in the league against right-handers, rendering Greene and his 28% strikeout rate in play as a spot starter and DFS play.
•	The Red Sox will treat Sunday as a bullpen game, with Josh Winckowski being called up from Triple-A Worcester to start. Winckowski has been in the rotation for the WooSox but likely won't be asked to give the Red Sox five frames. As such, you can roll the dice on a Boston reliever to vulture a win, with John Schreiber an under-the-radar choice, followed by Ryan Brasier, Matt Strahm and Hirokazu Sawamura.
•	While most everyone looks to Coors Field for hitters, don't overlook the Arizona Diamondbacks' right-handed contingent at home against Chicago Cubs southpaw Justin Steele. Switch-hitter and on-base machine Cooper Hummel has been leading off in this scenario, with Jordan Luplow in the 2-hole and Christian Walker cleaning up. All are available in more than 95% of ESPN leagues.

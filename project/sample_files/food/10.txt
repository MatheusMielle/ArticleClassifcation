The Best Potato Salad

Ingredients

6 eggs
10 red potatoes
1 cup mayonnaise
½ cup ranch dressing
⅓ cup dill pickle relish
2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard
1 ½ teaspoons salt
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
⅛ teaspoon paprika
⅛ teaspoon celery seed
1 onion, chopped 
¼ cup pepperoncini (Optional)
¼ cup sliced black olives (Optional)

Step 1
Place the eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and fill with water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Remove from the heat and let the eggs stand in the hot water for 15 minutes. Pour out the hot water; cool the eggs under cold running water in the sink. Peel and chop the cooled eggs.

Step 2
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and refrigerate until cold. Peel and cube once cold.

Step 3
Stir together the mayonnaise, ranch dressing, relish, mustard, salt, pepper, paprika, and celery seed in a mixing bowl. Add the eggs, potatoes, onion, pepperoncini, and olives; stir until evenly mixed. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving.

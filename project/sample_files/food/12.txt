Abuela's Picadillo

Ingredients
2 pounds lean ground beef 
¼ cup olive oil
½ onion, chopped 
½ green bell pepper, chopped
2 tablespoons minced garlic
2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce
2 cups water
½ cup red cooking wine
3 tablespoons hot sauce (such as Louisiana®)
1 (1.41 ounce) package sazon seasoning (such as Badia® Tropical®)
1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon ground bay leaf
3 ounces Spanish-style olives
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 small butternut squash, peeled and cut into cubes

Step 1
Cook and stir ground beef in a large stockpot until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain grease.

Step 2
Heat olive oil in small skillet over medium heat. Add onion, green bell pepper, and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir into beef in the stockpot.

Step 3
Pour tomato sauce, water, cooking wine, and hot sauce into the stockpot. Stir in sazon seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, pepper, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer picadillo, uncovered, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.

Step 4
Split olives in half with your fingers and stir into the picadillo. Add squash. Simmer until liquid reduces but picadillo is not dry, 45 to 60 minutes. Season with salt.

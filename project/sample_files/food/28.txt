Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs lamb (or beef)
2 medium onions
5 medium carrots
3 cup long grain rice
3 bay leaves
1 bulb of garlic
1/2 cup olive oil
salt to taste
pepper to taste
2 tsp cumin (optional)

Prepare ingredients for the recipe. Clean carrots and cut them into long slices about 1/4-inch thick. Dice onions into small pieces. Cut meat into 1-inch cubes.
Preheat oil in the Dutch oven over high heat. Using tongs, brown the sides of the meat. Add onions and carrots and cook until the onion turns translucent and the carrots soften.
Cooking dish with meat carrots and onion
Add rice and bay leaves to the Dutch oven. Saute for a couple of minutes. Remove a couple of the top layers of a garlic head and cut off the small part of the clove edges. Place the garlic clove inside of the rice. Cover the cooking ingredients with boiled water. The water should be filled just about 1-inch over the rice. Season with salt and pepper.
Pot with rice and veggies and liquid
Once it simmers, turn the heat down to very low. Cook for about 40-50 minutes. About 20 minutes into cooking, turn over the top layer of rice to promote even cooking.

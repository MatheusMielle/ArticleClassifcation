Yogurt-Marinated Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients

¼ cup plain yogurt
¼ cup lemon juice 
¼ cup canola oil
3 tablespoons white vinegar
4 cloves garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced
2 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed

Step 1
Combine yogurt, lemon juice, 1/4 cup oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, paprika, cumin, and oregano in a large glass or ceramic bowl; mix well. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.

Step 2
Remove chicken from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.

Step 3
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil in batches until tender and browned, about 5 minutes per batch. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
